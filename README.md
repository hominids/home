## Hominid Landing Page ðŸ–¥ ðŸ’» ðŸ“±

### What is Hominid? - A Human ID? 
"The only plan is that there is no plan." Hominid is an experimental community that tests and integrates blockchain applications such as the Habitat rollup and its voting modules. The name "Hominid" is derived from the evolutionary branch of great apes in which humans have decended. The name is also a play on the phrase "Human ID", and thus it may fit within the category of an identity management âˆ‚App, much like the [Origin Identity Playground](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-playground), [Universal Profile Accounts](http://universalprofile.cloud/), and/or a multisig that utilizes polymorphic biometric data (fingerprint, eyescan, faceID, voice recognition, etc) and human DNA (buccal swabs / polymerase chain reaction(PCR)) as zero-knowledge signatures. Clearly, identity is a broad term that may encompass many aspects of a human, and thus high transactional throughput may be a preparatory measure for success. While the management of identity on Layer 1 Ethereum would require excessive gas fees, Layer 2 rollups may provide an ideal environment for such applications. 

While these ideas and inferences may never come to fruition, important resulting coversations around ethics, product-design, and/or infrastructure for decentralized self-sovereign identity is amplifed. These discussions are always welcome at Hominid!

### Why Next.js?
Nextjs can use well-supported react packages and can be integrated with The Truffle Framework to build âˆ‚Apps. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

*** suggested: use yarn
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
